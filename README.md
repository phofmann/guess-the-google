# Guess-the-Google

A long while ago, during studying, there was a very addictive game called "GUESS-THE-GOOGLE" by [Grant Robinson](https://www.grantrobinson.nz/).
The object of the game is to guess a keyword based on a grid of 20 images. At that time it was built in Flash and somehow vanished.

I thought it was pretty cool but could't find a working version anymore. At the same time, my daughter asked me how hard it is to build a cool game using a computer...

Here we are...
